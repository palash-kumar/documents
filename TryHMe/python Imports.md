In Python, we can import libraries, which are a collection of files that contain functions. Think of importing a library as importing functions you can use that have been already written for you. For example, there is a "date" library that gives you access to hundreds of different functions for anything date and time-related.

import datetime
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
print(current_time)
We import other libraries using the import keyword. Then in Python, we use that import's library name to reference its functions. In the example above, we import datetime, then access the .now() method by calling library_name.method_name(). Copy and paste the example above into the code editor.

Here are some popular libraries you may find useful in scripting as a pentester:

Request - simple HTTP library.
Scapy - send, sniff, dissect and forge network packets
Pwntools - a CTF & exploit development library.
Many of these libraries are already built into the programming language; however, libraries written by other programmers not already installed in your machine can be installed using an application called pip, which is Python's package manager. Let's say you want to install the "scapy" library (which allows you to craft your own packets in code and send them to other machines); you install it first by running the command pip install scapy, after which in your program you can now import the scapy library.
